    To convert your web scraping code, which uses Selenium and Python, into a reusable function that can be called from an Express.js route, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Python Function:** Wrap your web scraping code in a Python function that takes any necessary arguments and returns the scraped data. For example, if you want to pass a URL to scrape, you can create a function like this:

   ```python
   from selenium import webdriver

   def scrape_data(url):
       # Initialize the WebDriver
       driver = webdriver.Chrome()
       
       try:
           # Navigate to the provided URL
           driver.get(url)
           
           # Add your web scraping logic here
           # ...
           
           # Return the scraped data
           return scraped_data
       finally:
           # Always quit the WebDriver to release resources
           driver.quit()
   ```

   Replace `scraped_data` with the actual data you want to return.

2. **Expose the Python Function as an API:** You can expose this Python function as a simple API using a framework like Flask. Here's an example using Flask:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

   app = Flask(__name)

   @app.route('/scrape', methods=['GET'])
   def scrape():
       url = request.args.get('url')  # Get the URL from the query parameters
       data = scrape_data(url)  # Call the Python function

       return jsonify(data)  # Return the scraped data as JSON
   ```

   This Flask app provides a route, `/scrape`, where you can pass a `url` query parameter to specify the URL to scrape.

3. **Run the Express.js Server:** You can now run your Express.js server alongside this Flask app. When you receive a request to the `/scrape` route in your Express app, you can make an HTTP request to your Flask server, passing the URL as a query parameter, and retrieve the scraped data as a response.

4. **Make HTTP Requests from Express.js to Flask:** In your Express.js route, use a library like `axios` or `node-fetch` to make an HTTP GET request to your Flask server, passing the URL you want to scrape.

   Example using `axios`:

   ```javascript
   const axios = require('axios');

   app.get('/scrape', async (req, res) => {
     const { url } = req.query;

     try {
       const response = await axios.get('http://your-flask-server/scrape', {
         params: {
           url: url,
         },
       });
       const scrapedData = response.data;
       res.json(scrapedData);
     } catch (error) {
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error scraping data' });
     }
   });
   ```

This setup allows you to make web scraping requests to your Flask server from your Express.js app by providing a URL, and the Flask server returns the scraped data. You can further customize the function to accept other parameters and modify the scraping logic accordingly.
